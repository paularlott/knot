# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

## 1. Purpose

This Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") governs contributions of code, documentation, and other materials ("Contributions") to the Project. It grants the Project Owner the rights needed to use, modify, relicense, and distribute Contributions. The Project consists of the open-source "Core Project" under the Apache 2.0 license and any derivative works, including commercial, closed-source, or private Enterprise versions maintained by the Project Owner.

## 2. Definitions and Parties

- **Contribution:** Any original work of authorship submitted to the Project in any form, including but not limited to code, documentation, tests, designs, patches, pull requests, issue comments, or email submissions.
- **Contributor:** Includes an individual contributor and, where applicable, the entity they are employed by or otherwise acting on behalf of when submitting a Contribution.
- **Core Project:** The primary Knot open-source project, specifically the codebase and related materials that are publicly maintained and distributed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
- **Project Owner:** Paul Arlott, located in Western Australia.
- **Project:** The Knot open-source project and any derivative works, including commercial, closed-source, or private versions maintained by the Project Owner.

## 3. Copyright License

The Contributor retains all right, title, and interest in and to their Contribution. The Contributor grants the Project Owner a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable license to:

- reproduce the Contribution
- prepare derivative works **in whole or in part**
- publicly display, perform, and distribute the Contribution
- incorporate the Contribution into any Project Owner product or service, including commercial, closed-source, or proprietary offerings
- relicense the Contribution under any license now known or later developed

This license applies to both source and binary forms and to all current and future versions of the Project. No other rights, licenses, or warranties not expressly stated in this CLA are granted by the Contributor to the Project Owner.

## 4. Patent License

To the extent the Contributor owns patent rights that would be infringed by the Contribution, the Contributor grants the Project Owner a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable patent license to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise exploit the Contribution and derivative works.

## 5. Moral Rights

Where permitted by law, the Contributor waives or agrees not to assert any moral rights in the Contribution against the Project Owner. If a full waiver is not permitted, the Contributor grants the Project Owner a broad license to exercise such rights.

## 6. No Trademark License

This CLA does not grant any rights to use the Project Owner’s trademarks, service marks, or trade names, such as the name "Knot," without the prior written consent of the Project Owner.

## 7. Representations and Warranties

The Contributor represents and warrants that:

- the Contribution is the original work of the Contributor or they have the right to submit it;
- the Contribution does not violate the intellectual property rights (including copyright, patent, or trade secret rights) of any third party;
- to the best of the Contributor's knowledge, the Contribution does not infringe upon any patent rights, and the Contributor discloses any known prior art relevant to patent claims contained in the Contribution. **The Contributor is not required to conduct a patent search.**
- **If the Contributor is employed, they represent that their employer has authorized the Contribution or that the Contribution is made outside the scope of employment.**
- they are legally permitted to grant the rights described in this CLA.

Except as required by law, the Contribution is provided "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

## 8. No Warranty of Non-Infringement

The Project Owner provides no warranty or guarantee that the Project, or any Contribution, is free from claims of infringement of any third-party intellectual property rights. All risk regarding such claims is assumed by the user of the Project.

## 9. Further Assurances

The Contributor agrees to execute such documents and perform such acts as the Project Owner may reasonably request to help the Project Owner perfect, record, and enforce its rights in the Contribution.

## 10. No Confidential Information

The Contributor will not submit confidential or proprietary information. If confidential information is required for a specific collaboration, the parties will execute a separate agreement.

## 11. Third-Party Code

If the Contribution includes third-party code, the Contributor must disclose its origin and provide the applicable license terms. **The Contributor must not submit code licensed under GPL-2.0-only, GPL-3.0-only, AGPL-3.0, or any other copyleft license that would impose reciprocal licensing obligations on the Project.**

## 12. Termination

The Contributor may terminate this CLA for future Contributions by written notice. Rights granted to the Project Owner before termination survive termination.

## 13. No Revocation of Granted Rights

All licenses granted to the Project Owner under this CLA are perpetual and irrevocable. The Contributor may not revoke any rights granted for Contributions already submitted and accepted by the Project Owner.

## 14. No Obligation to Use Contribution

The Project Owner has no obligation to use, include, or otherwise incorporate any Contribution into the Project. Every submission is subject to review and may be accepted or rejected at the sole discretion of the Project Owner.

## 15. Governing Law

This CLA is governed by the laws of Western Australia.

## 16. Choice of Venue

Any legal action or proceeding arising under this CLA will be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in Perth, Western Australia, and the parties hereby irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue therein.

## 17. Entire Agreement

This CLA constitutes the entire agreement regarding Contributions. If any provision is held invalid, the remainder remains in effect. The Project Owner may update this CLA; any such updates will apply only to Contributions made after the effective date of the new CLA, unless a Contributor explicitly agrees in writing to be bound by the new terms for past Contributions.

## 18. Acceptance

Submitting a Contribution (e.g., opening a pull request) constitutes acceptance of this CLA.

## 19. Signature
