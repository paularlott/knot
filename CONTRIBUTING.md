# Contributing to Knot

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Knot. We welcome improvements, bug fixes, documentation updates, and new ideas. This guide explains how to contribute and the legal requirements for submitting code.

## 1. Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Before we can accept your contribution, you must accept the **Knot Contributor License Agreement (CLA)**.

This ensures that:

- you retain ownership of your work
- the Project Owner receives the rights needed to use, modify, relicense, and distribute your Contribution
- the Project can safely be used in both its open‑source core and commercial Enterprise versions, ensuring the project's sustainability

You only need to sign the CLA **once**, and it applies to **all Knot repositories**.

### **Sign the CLA**

Please complete the CLA acceptance form here: [https://forms.gle/bkZPYEzWskbXsfPS8](https://forms.gle/bkZPYEzWskbXsfPS8)

After signing, your GitHub username will be added to the approved contributor list.
Pull requests from contributors who have not signed the CLA will be marked as **cla: required** and cannot be merged.

---

## 2. How the CLA Check Works

When you open or update a pull request:

- a GitHub Action checks whether your GitHub username is listed in `.clabot.json`
- if you have signed the CLA, your PR will be labeled **cla: ok**
- if not, it will be labeled **cla: required**, and a bot will post instructions on how to sign

Once your username is added to the registry, the PR will automatically update to **cla: ok**.
