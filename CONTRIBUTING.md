    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified

Every contribution must be signed with a Developer Certificate of Origin, therefore each commit must include a DCO:

```

`-s` or `--signoff` can be used to add the Signed-off-by to the end of the commit message.
