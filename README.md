# knot

Knot is a powerful tool that simplifies the deployment and management of developer environments within a Nomad cluster through a web interface. It enables the creation of environment templates and allows developers to launch or terminate environments as needed, eliminating the need for each developer to manage their own configurations.

This project is under active development and is not feature complete, as such there's no guarantee of compatibility between builds.

This project is designed to be used within trusted environments rather than on the open internet.
